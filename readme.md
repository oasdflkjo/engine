# Engine init

A simple OpenGL project that sets up a window with GLFW, loads OpenGL functions with GLAD, and renders a basic spinning cube using cglm for matrix transformations. This project is designed to explore and demonstrate foundational OpenGL techniques with modern libraries.

## Features

- **GLFW**: Window and input management.
- **GLAD**: OpenGL function loader for modern OpenGL features.
- **cglm**: Lightweight mathematics library for matrix and vector operations.
- **Spinning Cube**: Basic 3D cube rendered in a window with dynamic rotation.

## TODO

- **Add ImGui**: Integrate ImGui to create a generic menu structure with interactable panels for simulations and demos.
- **Particle Simulation**: Implement a simple particle simulation with OpenGL, showcasing basic physics and motion.
- **Compute Shaders**: Experiment with compute shaders to handle high-performance operations directly on the GPU.
- **Advanced Rendering**: Add shaders for visual effects, lighting, and possibly texturing.
